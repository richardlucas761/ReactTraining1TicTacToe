# ReactTraining1TicTacToe

Starting with the instructions found here:

https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

## Installing Node

```node-v24.12.0-x64.msi```

## Downloading files from CodeSandbox didn't work?

Following these instructions:

![alt text](img/CodeSandboxDownload1.png "Tutorial instructions")

![alt text](img/CodeSandboxDownload2.png "CodeSandbox")

Downloaded a zip file in this format with a GUID filename; but the zip file downloaded was empty.

```2aea0ee8-3ce7-457b-b2ab-118ed8059c8f.zip```

The file structure and file content was visible in CodeSandbox so it was possible to just create the required files and copy and paste their content. 

Perhaps CodeSandbox expects you to log in before you can download the files?

## Visual Studio 2026 Community edition

Editing files in this version of VS.

## npm install

Creating the required files in this repo manually enabled this command to be run.

## npm start

Launched the same application as had been seen in the "Preview" in CodeSandbox, but running locally.

## Git Ignore

Including ```node_modules/``` didn't seem correct so this git ignore file was added https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/main/Node.gitignore

*Do we also want to include the ```package-lock.json``` file in source control? Can fix later.*
